This is the most special (and biggest!) entity I've created so far. It is an in-universe computer, with various features.
It has various programs it can run (with many more still to come). 

This program is a simple text file. In the file "InterfacePresets.yaml", I can create presets for groups of icons. These presets are represented by floppy disks that the user can insert into the computer when they interact with it. 

portfolio2=
Here's a list of all the programs I've made that I plan to keep in the mod: {n2}{# 00FFFF}Text{#} - A standard text file. Window size changes based on the total height of the text.{n}{# 00FF00}Info{#} - A glorified text file. That's it, the only difference is the icon and the name (maybe I should give it a secondary purpose though).{n}{# 0000FF}Access{#} - A very, very specific program that I will get into later (it's heavily related to the mod's story).{n}{# FFFF00}Fountain{#} - A program that checks a condition and makes a fountain in another area move, revealing a hidden passage.{n}{# 000000}Life{#} - Conway's Game Of Life, with some added bonus features.
lifeInfo=It's Conway's Game of Life (with some bonus features):{n}Randomize: Does what you'd expect.{n}Save: Saves the current layout in 1 of 6 slots. If all slots are full, it replaces the earliest saved slot.{n}Load: Loads the most recent slot. If used multiple times, it cycles through the rest of the slots.

accessInfo=This program lets the user type in a phrase. In another file, there is a dictionary of keys that link to the names of various levels (rooms) in the map. If the user inputs the correct key, they will activate a sequence where an animation plays and they are teleported to the cooresponding level. 


interfaceNoPower=It won't turn on.
interfaceNoFloppy=There's nothing on the screen.

elevatorRocks=
A cluster of rocks is embeded in the main control panel.

	{# 000000}I don't like this.
	This thing just appears. Out of nowhere, not a scratch in sight.
	It's exactly what we need for digital expeditions, down to the smallest detail.
	And not one person bats an eye.
	It's way too perfect.
	He didn't build it. None of us built it.
	So why are there so many of them?
	Are we being watched?
	If you ask me, we should stay well away from it.{#}
codeResearchA=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}We've begun research into a strange phenomena.
	The villagers have on occasion reported strange floating objects that seem to appear under certain conditions.
	Goals: 1. Research how a "floating object anomaly" (FOA) is created. 
	2. Determine how an FOA affects it's environment.
	3. Determine how to predict when one will appear next.{#}

codeResearchB=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}The info we have aquired about FOAs is limited, but patterns have begun to emerge.
	Each FOA seems to require a key in the form of a code.
	Furthermore, the area in the direct vicinity of an FOA will shift to reflect its code.
	This is usually where the patterns stop.{#}

codeResearchC=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}The logic and reasoning behind a code seems to vary per FOA, but they all share one similarity:
	Directions.
	Each code is a combination of the 8 cardinal directions.
	Up, Down, Left, Right, Up-left, Down-left, Up-right, Down-right.
	They seem to gravitate towards themes, the codes we've managed to decipher tend to reflect the general area as a whole.
	For example: We recently encountered an FOA down in Pipeworks.
	Near the area of the FOA was a long winding pipe, no intersections.
	Quite odd, considering most of the pipes in Pipeworks are an interconnected mess.
	Starting from the bottom left of the pipe and working our way up led us to the code.{#}

codeResearchD=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOAs react to physical contact.
	The reaction varies dramatically given the substance it contacts.{#}
codeResearchE=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Recently we've been testing various substances on FOAs.
	Water flows around it, like the FOA has a negative gravitational field. So far, no other substances act this way.
	Small rocks bounce off at blinding speeds. Very dangerous.
	Human flesh and clothing create a shockwave that propels anyone near it a decent distance.
	We've yet to find a way to transport FOAs to another location.{#}
codeResearchF=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Since we can't move an FOA with force, one of our members suggested the bold idea of creating one ourselves.
	A bit risky, but nothing else has worked, so why not? Don't think the boss cares what we do as long as we're figuring stuff out.{#}

codeResearchG=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOA creation attempt 1: Failure.
	We set up a board with arrows in a sequence: 
	Up, Left, Right, Down.
	We tried pointing in the directions, interpretive dance, even made a handheld controller with directional inputs, but nothing happened.
	Was it too simple? Was it because it wasn't themed? Was it too on the nose?{#}

codeResearchH=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOA creation attempt 2: Failure.
	We tried arranging arrows using leaves, but that didn't work either.
	Maybe... Only a representation of the code needs to be present for the FOA to appear?
	The information required to solve one might not have the same area limitations...{#}
codeResearchI=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOA creation attempt 3: Success!
	We've set up a sort of scavenger hunt for this one.
	We've realized that these codes only work if kept in secrecy.
	The first subject was told everything. Once they found the correct sequence... nothing happened.
	The second subject was only told to find a secret directional sequence. Still, nothing happened.
	It seems if they feel they're being revealed too directly, they won't work.
	So if you're reading this, boss, uhhhhhh... good luck! It's quite the sticky situation!{#}

	{# 000000}We've received reports sightings of floating objects seperate from the FOA we've been monitoring recently.
	These objects are diamond-shaped, have a soft, green glow, and gently float up and down.
	It ignores any physical contact, phasing through solid matter.
	We should investigate. It could be a new material!{#}
refillNotesB=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Like FOAs, it is impossible to alter the location of these objects.

	What do we do now?{#}
refillNotesD=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Observations:
	Our prototype is unstable, and shatters roughly 5-10 seconds after creation.
	When it shatters, it loses its green glow and the frequency of its floating slows dramatically.{#}
refillNotesE=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Observations:
	While in this state, it is very fragile, and will shatter at the slightest touch.
	Subjects who shatter them report an instant feeling of fatigue and nausea.
	However, they don't seem to respond to touching other crystals.
	For the time being, we've confined them inside these chambers.{#}
