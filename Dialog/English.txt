TEXT2= 20XX/05/10{n}This will be the first record of my existence here. My crew and I were making our way to our place of work when the world around us went dark. Our driver mentioned the steering wheel was uncontrollable for a second or two during this time.{n} We came to soon after, finding ourselves in the seemingly endless boughs of rock corriders this place holds. None of us are particularly atheletic, so navigating through this labyrinth was an ordeal.

TEXT3= Luckily, we still had many supplies in our vehicle. As we made our way through these twisting caves, the ground beneath one of us gave way and half of us tumbled into a newly opened up route. We made sure everyone was safe, and then decided to look around for anything we could use to hoist ourselves out.

TEXT4= We were looking for materials to build an escape route. We instead found a civilization.{n}Ok, well, maybe not a "civilization", more of a village, but if I had said "village" it wouldn't have sounded as cool.
