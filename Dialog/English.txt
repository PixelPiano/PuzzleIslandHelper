This is the most special (and biggest!) entity I've created so far. It is an in-universe computer, with various features.
It has various programs it can run (with many more still to come). 

This program is a simple text file. In the file "InterfacePresets.yaml", I can create presets for groups of icons. These presets are represented by floppy disks that the user can insert into the computer when they interact with it. 

portfolio2=
Here's a list of all the programs I've made that I plan to keep in the mod: {n2}{# 00FFFF}Text{#} - A standard text file. Window size changes based on the total height of the text.{n}{# 00FF00}Info{#} - A glorified text file. That's it, the only difference is the icon and the name (maybe I should give it a secondary purpose though).{n}{# 0000FF}Access{#} - A very, very specific program that I will get into later (it's heavily related to the mod's story).{n}{# FFFF00}Fountain{#} - A program that checks a condition and makes a fountain in another area move, revealing a hidden passage.{n}{# 000000}Life{#} - Conway's Game Of Life, with some added bonus features.
lifeInfo=It's Conway's Game of Life (with some bonus features):{n}Randomize: Does what you'd expect.{n}Save: Saves the current layout in 1 of 6 slots. If all slots are full, it replaces the earliest saved slot.{n}Load: Loads the most recent slot. If used multiple times, it cycles through the rest of the slots.

accessInfo=This program lets the user type in a phrase. In another file, there is a dictionary of keys that link to the names of various levels (rooms) in the map. If the user inputs the correct key, they will activate a sequence where an animation plays and they are teleported to the cooresponding level. 


interfaceNoPower=It won't turn on.
interfaceNoFloppy=There's nothing on the screen.

elevatorRocks=
A cluster of rocks is embeded in the main control panel.

findFloppy=

Hm? There's something in that slot.

GREENHEART= Remember when we came through here before?{n0}{mtRight}You mean with the scout group? When you saw your so-called "playground"?{/mtRight}{n0}Yes, and that DID happen. I wish you would just... just trust me on that. You keep insisting it's fake.{n0}{mtRight}I keep insisting because I vividly remember the expedition, and you never left my side.{/mtRight}{n0}...I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about this anymore.

BLUEHEART= Hey, what's going to happen to us?{n0}{mtRight} What do you mean? Like, in the long-term or...?{/mtRight}{n0}I mean, the lab won't stay powered forever. Even on backup energy, it's going to run out eventually.{n0}{mtRight}I think the generator has a renewable energy source... but only if the pipes don't clog up.{/mtRight}{n0}But if power were to go offline... Would we just disappear?

DIGILORE1={mtRight} Just for the record, I believe your story about the playground.{/mtRight}{n0}Wait, then why did you act like I was lying?{n0}{mtRight} Because I wanted to keep talking. You've been so quiet recently, it worries me. Have you been occupying yourself with something?{n0}{/mtRight}Not really. Well, aside from keeping these buggers from flying off... You've got it good, y'know?{n0}{mtRight}Maybe to you, but it feels so weird being one eye short...{/mtRight}

DIGILORE2=Any abnormalties?{n0}{mtRight}Do you mean abnormal from here, or abnormal from common sense? If the latter, then yes.{n0}{/mtRight}The latter.{n0}{mtRight}There's been an influx of strange readings lately. Can't really tell what they are though.{n0}{/mtRight}That was incredibly helpful, thank you.{n0}{mtRight}How many are loose now?{n0}{mtRight}7 :(

DIGILORE3={mtRight} So I've been trying to come up with a plan to get out of here. Any ideas?{n0}{/mtRight}Personally, I'm fine staying here, since escaping will likely just lead us to instant death.{n0}{mtRight}Well, yes, but what if we were able to escape a different way?{n0}{/mtRight}Like, with our bodies still intact? Will the physics still be the same?{n0}{/mtRight}Funny you should bring that up...

DIGILORE4={mtRight}Y'know those observers we set up around the village?{n0}{/mtRight}You mean the ones that I invented..? Yes I know them.{n0}{mtRight}Right, well I still have limited access to the lab, and I found that the readings there match up perfectly with the readings from here. What's more, I think the area in here is shifting.{n0}{/mtRight}So... What does that mean?

TEXT1= To do:{n}- Talk with village leader about expanding available research bounds.{n}- 	 Conduct tests on temple fluids (WEAR GLOVES THIS TIME.){n}- Fix broken stabilizer in sector 2.{n}- Laundry.

TEXT2= 20XX/05/10{n}This will be the first record of our existence here. My brother and I were investigating what we believed to be the ruins of a temple built by an ancient civilization. Even though we're scientists and not archeologists, we needed to verify something. As we explored the temple, we came across a large, pristine mirror. We were drawn to it immediately, as it seemed to radiate a somewhat otherworldly aura. But the moment I touched it's surface, the world around me spiraled into madness. Shapes and colors blended and twisted in and out. I shut my eyes, since, while it looked pretty cool, it also hurt my head.

TEXT3= A moment later my brother and I found ourselves knee-deep in a small body of water. We looked around ourselves and saw leaves and crystals strung about, connecting the floor and walls to the ceiling. With nowhere to go, we picked a direction and started walking. Walking was better than sitting around waiting to starve. 

TEXT5= The village was covered in blues and purples. The villagers were wary of us, but oddly they seemed terrified of me in partiular. One of them who seemed to have high authority took one look at me and ordered the both of us to come with them. We didn't really know what to do, so we followed him, hoping to get some answers.

TEXT7= Once we entered the small house, it seemed to only have one room, but it was littered with books and strange scrawlings. The one who lead us here told us he was the village Leader, and he wanted to evaluate us to make sure we could be trusted.

TEXT11= When the time came for the scout group to move out, they breifed us on some rules we had to follow no matter what: 1. Duck if we hear any high pitched noises. 2. Be prepared for any and all temperatures. 3. Stick close to the main group, and never wander off on our own.

TEXT12= We ventured into the labyrinth, running rope through stakes in the ground to mark our path as we went. Aside from the usual dull, grey rocky texture lining the floors and walls, we encountered areas that seemed to sort of... pop in and pop out, almost instantly. We breifly walked through a lush slice of forestry, only to then find ourselves in a warehouse-like room. Then we were back in the rocky atmosphere of the labyrinth.

TEXT13= I saw a playground. Empty. But it wasn't just any playground, this was the playground from my elementary school. We would spend hours playing on it, so I know without a doubt it was the same one. 

TEXT14= As I stepped over the crude line seperating the stone from the gravel, a wave of nostalgia hit me instantly. I must have lost track of time, because by the time I realized I had broken rule 3, it was too late. I could no longer hear the chatter of the scout group. I rushed over to the corner I had turned earlier, knowing the rope had to still be there, but all I saw was one end of it, perfectly sliced off.

TEXT15= I tried screaming, hoping someone would hear me, but I got no reply. But once I looked up, I saw that where I was... was nothing like where I had been before I left the group. The chill, damp atmosphere of the labyrinth had turned into a black, empty nothingness. The ground was devoid of any character, the landscape was empty, there was no color anywhere. I thought I had gone mad.

TEXT16= Then, as if it were all a dream, I heard my brother from behind me. Not just my brother, but the whole scout team. I had somehow wound up ahead of them. Immediately I profusely apologized for my reckless behavior, but they all seemed confused. I told them I went off on my own, but they said that I was gone at most for 10 seconds. They just assumed I fell behind slightly so they went back to check on me before I showed up in front of them.



INFO1= This device is to be used only by laboratory personnel. Please report any unauthorized individuals operating laboratory devices to the village leader. If you don't know whether you qualify as laboratory personnel, then you do not.
