This is the most special (and biggest!) entity I've created so far. It is an in-universe computer, with various features.
It has various programs it can run (with many more still to come). 

This program is a simple text file. In the file "InterfacePresets.yaml", I can create presets for groups of icons. These presets are represented by floppy disks that the user can insert into the computer when they interact with it. 

portfolio2=
Here's a list of all the programs I've made that I plan to keep in the mod: {n2}{# 00FFFF}Text{#} - A standard text file. Window size changes based on the total height of the text.{n}{# 00FF00}Info{#} - A glorified text file. That's it, the only difference is the icon and the name (maybe I should give it a secondary purpose though).{n}{# 0000FF}Access{#} - A very, very specific program that I will get into later (it's heavily related to the mod's story).{n}{# FFFF00}Fountain{#} - A program that checks a condition and makes a fountain in another area move, revealing a hidden passage.{n}{# 000000}Life{#} - Conway's Game Of Life, with some added bonus features.
lifeInfo=It's Conway's Game of Life (with some bonus features):{n}Randomize: Does what you'd expect.{n}Save: Saves the current layout in 1 of 6 slots. If all slots are full, it replaces the earliest saved slot.{n}Load: Loads the most recent slot. If used multiple times, it cycles through the rest of the slots.

accessInfo=This program lets the user type in a phrase. In another file, there is a dictionary of keys that link to the names of various levels (rooms) in the map. If the user inputs the correct key, they will activate a sequence where an animation plays and they are teleported to the cooresponding level. 


interfaceNoPower=It won't turn on.
interfaceNoFloppy=There's nothing on the screen.

elevatorRocks=
A cluster of rocks is embeded in the main control panel.

	I've hidden it in a riddle, scattered across multiple notes around the lab. I know how forgetful you are.{#}

fountainHintD=

	{# 000000}YES. Why can't you just talk to me about it in person, you're hopeless.{#}
codeResearchA=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}We've begun research into a strange phenomena.
	The villagers have on occasion reported strange floating objects that seem to appear under certain conditions.
	Goals: 1. Research how a "floating object anomaly" (FOA) is created. 
	2. Determine how an FOA affects it's environment.
	3. Determine how to predict when one will appear next.{#}

codeResearchB=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}The info we have aquired about FOAs is limited, but patterns have begun to emerge.
	Each FOA seems to require a key in the form of a code.
	Furthermore, the area in the direct vicinity of an FOA will shift to reflect its code.
	This is usually where the patterns stop.{#}

codeResearchC=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}The logic and reasoning behind a code seems to vary per FOA, but they all share one similarity:
	Directions.
	Each code is a combination of the 8 cardinal directions.
	Up, down, left right, up left, down left, up right, down right.
	They seem to gravitate towards themes, the codes we've managed to decipher tend to reflect the general area as a whole.
	For example: We recently encountered an FOA down in Pipeworks.
	Near the area of the FOA was a long winding pipe, no intersections.
	Quite odd, considering most of the pipes in Pipeworks are an interconnected mess.
	Starting from the bottom left of the pipe and working our way up led us to the code.{#}

codeResearchD=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOAs react to physical contact.
	If touched, they release a small shockwave, pushing anything near away from itself.
	We learned the hard way that the strength of the shockwave scales.{#}
codeResearchE=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}We tested various substances on FOAs.
	Water flowed around it, like the FOA had a negative gravitational field. No other substances acted this way.
	Small rocks would bounce off at blinding speeds. Very dangerous.
	We've yet to find a way to transport FOAs to another location.{#}
codeResearchF=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Since we can't move an FOA with force, one of our members suggested the bold idea of creating one ourselves.
	A bit risky, but nothing else has worked, so why not? The bosses don't care what we do as long as we're figuring stuff out.{#}

codeResearchG=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOA creation attempt 1: Failure.
	We set up a board with arrows in a sequence: 
	Up, Left, Right, Down.
	Using a custom made controller, we inputed the code, but nothing happened.
	Was it too simple? Was it because it wasn't themed? Was it too on the nose?{#}

codeResearchH=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOA creation attempt 2: Failure.
	We tried arranging arrows using leaves, but that didn't work either.
	Maybe only the code needs to be present near the FOA? 
	The information required to solve one might not have the same area limitations...{#}
codeResearchI=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}FOA creation attempt 3: Success!
	We've set up a sort of scavenger hunt for this one.
	The code is 6 digits long, and the key is sticky notes! 
	We've realized that these codes only work if kept in secrecy.
	If they feel they're being revealed too directly, they won't work.
	So if you're reading this, boss... uhhhhhh good luck?{#}

refillNotesA=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}We've received reports sightings of floating objects seperate from the FOA we've been monitoring recently.
	These objects are diamond-shaped, have a soft, green glow, and gently float up and down.
	It ignores any physical contact, phasing through solid matter.
	If it does break, we have yet to find a trigger.{#}

refillNotesB=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Like FOAs, it is impossible to alter the location of these objects.
	So, like FOAs, we're attempting to create one ourselves.
	Progress has been... slow. We can recreate the shape and glow, but it's unstable.{#}

refillNotesC=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}We've successfully created a stable replication of these objects!

	...
	What do we do now?{#}
refillNotesD=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Observations:
	Our prototype is unstable, and shatters roughly 5-10 seconds after creation.
	When it shatters, it loses its green glow and the frequency of its floating slows dramatically.{#}
refillNotesE=
	[Paper left normal]
	{# 000000}Observations:
	While in this state, it is very fragile, and will shatter at the slightest touch.
	Subjects who shatter them report an instant feeling of fatigue and nausea.
	However, they don't seem to respond to touching other crystals.
	For the time being, we've confined them inside these chambers.{#}

TEXT2= 20XX/05/10{n}This will be the first record of our existence here. My brother and I were investigating what we believed to be the ruins of a temple built by an ancient civilization. Even though we're scientists and not archeologists, we needed to verify something. As we explored the temple, we came across a large, pristine mirror. We were drawn to it immediately, as it seemed to radiate a somewhat otherworldly aura. But the moment I touched it's surface, the world around me spiraled into madness. Shapes and colors blended and twisted in and out. I shut my eyes, since, while it looked pretty cool, it also hurt my head.

TEXT3= A moment later my brother and I found ourselves knee-deep in a small body of water. We looked around ourselves and saw leaves and crystals strung about, connecting the floor and walls to the ceiling. With nowhere to go, we picked a direction and started walking. Walking was better than sitting around waiting to starve. 

TEXT5= The village was covered in blues and purples. The villagers were wary of us, but oddly they seemed terrified of me in partiular. One of them who seemed to have high authority took one look at me and ordered the both of us to come with them. We didn't really know what to do, so we followed him, hoping to get some answers.

TEXT7= Once we entered the small house, it seemed to only have one room, but it was littered with books and strange scrawlings. The one who lead us here told us he was the village Leader, and he wanted to evaluate us to make sure we could be trusted.

TEXT11= When the time came for the scout group to move out, they breifed us on some rules we had to follow no matter what: 1. Duck if we hear any high pitched noises. 2. Be prepared for any and all temperatures. 3. Stick close to the main group, and never wander off on our own.

TEXT12= We ventured into the labyrinth, running rope through stakes in the ground to mark our path as we went. Aside from the usual dull, grey rocky texture lining the floors and walls, we encountered areas that seemed to sort of... pop in and pop out, almost instantly. We breifly walked through a lush slice of forestry, only to then find ourselves in a warehouse-like room. Then we were back in the rocky atmosphere of the labyrinth.

TEXT13= I saw a playground. Empty. But it wasn't just any playground, this was the playground from my elementary school. We would spend hours playing on it, so I know without a doubt it was the same one. 

TEXT14= As I stepped over the crude line seperating the stone from the gravel, a wave of nostalgia hit me instantly. I must have lost track of time, because by the time I realized I had broken rule 3, it was too late. I could no longer hear the chatter of the scout group. I rushed over to the corner I had turned earlier, knowing the rope had to still be there, but all I saw was one end of it, perfectly sliced off.

TEXT15= I tried screaming, hoping someone would hear me, but I got no reply. But once I looked up, I saw that where I was... was nothing like where I had been before I left the group. The chill, damp atmosphere of the labyrinth had turned into a black, empty nothingness. The ground was devoid of any character, the landscape was empty, there was no color anywhere. I thought I had gone mad.

TEXT16= Then, as if it were all a dream, I heard my brother from behind me. Not just my brother, but the whole scout team. I had somehow wound up ahead of them. Immediately I profusely apologized for my reckless behavior, but they all seemed confused. I told them I went off on my own, but they said that I was gone at most for 10 seconds. They just assumed I fell behind slightly so they went back to check on me before I showed up in front of them.

SCHOOLNOTEHINT=Due to some of the residents getting a bit... handsy with the school supplies, (doctor's gonna have a time) the village leader and I have elected to make a secluded storage underneath the school.
